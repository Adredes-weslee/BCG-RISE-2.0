## 🚀 Capstone: Customer Segmentation & Price Optimization

> A client-facing data science solution to improve pricing strategies and customer targeting for CS Tay, a leading frozen food distributor.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
1. Segment customers based on behavior using RFM + K-Means  
2. Identify price elasticity across SKUs in supermarket vs. retail segments  
3. Optimize pricing using Gurobi for constrained revenue maximization

### 🧪 Methods & Tools
- Data preprocessing + EDA
- K-Means clustering for segmentation
- Elasticity estimation via linear regression
- Optimization modeling via Gurobi
- Stakeholder-ready dashboards and presentations

### 📈 Outcomes
- Identified 5 key customer personas (e.g., Champions, Hibernating)
- Found cross-price effects among top SKUs
- Modeled optimized prices to generate an estimated **SGD 4M in revenue uplift**

📁 Full breakdown available in `capstone/README.md`
